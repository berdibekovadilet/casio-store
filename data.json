    "description": "Take control of speed and intelligence with a solar-powered analog-digital combination EDIFICE. Inspired by formula car suspension, the SOSPENSIONE ECB-2000 is the first EDIFICE with a carbon fiber-reinforced resin case, thanks to a unique case design that arranges the lugs in a four-arm configuration. The lugs too are reinforced with carbon fiber, bringing the true motorsports spirit to both the design and the materials of this timepiece. It’s a snap to sync with your smartphone via Bluetooth®. Tap into the dedicated app to access the to-the-second precision timekeeping that is so important for racing teams, and to effortlessly manage world time and transfer stopwatch data measured to the millisecond to your smartphone. The LED Super Illuminator light makes viewing the analog-digital face a non-issue, and the Tough Solar system keeps you charged and running even high-load functions with just a small amount of light.",
